# Name Shuffler

A Processing sketch to shuffle a list of (student or team) names, for project
presentation order.

To use:

1. Create a text file `data/names.txt`, with one name per line. (If this file
   does not exist, the program uses a test data set.)
2. Run the sketch. It will shuffle the names.
3. Click to shuffle the names again.
