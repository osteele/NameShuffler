# Name Shuffler

A Processing sketch to shuffle a list of (student or team) names, for project presentation order.

To use:

Create a text file `data/names.txt`, with one name per line.

(If this file does not exist, the program uses a test data set.)

Run the sketch. It will shuffle the names.

Click to shuffle the names again.
